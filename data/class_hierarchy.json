            "Description": "The course addresses two important needs of educators. First, educators should be aware of recent developments in the area of instructional technology. Second, educators must be able to select, develop, and effectively use appropriate instructional technologies to enhance learning and communication. To meet these needs, this course covers a wide range of instructional technologies that are used for instructional and administrative purposes. Traditional instructional media are considered in the course although significant emphasis is placed on more recent developments that involve the use of the computer and its applications in education. Instructional technologies such as computer-based instruction, computer-based testing, distance learning, interactive video, and intelligent instructional technologies are covered. Through course readings, discussions, and projects, students in the course are expected to gain skills in choosing appropriate instructional technologies, designing effective presentations that rely on those technologies, and properly using instructional technologies to enhance communication with an audience. Same as CI 484. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours. Prerequisite: HRD 411 or equivalent course in instructional design.",
